Your task is to create an electronic platform for trading commodities contracts. This platform will allow dealers to list the contracts they have available to buy or sell (we shall refer to this as posting orders)

trade these orders (aggressing on orders). 

Dealer messages consist of the ID of the dealer sending the message, followed by a command

Command Reference

POST
- Adds a buy or sell order to the "wall"
- orders on the wall are up for grabs (all or in part)

Output: a POST_CONFIRMATION message (defined later in this document).

REVOKE
- Removes an order from the "wall" by [Order ID]
- Only the dealer who originally entered the order is allowed to revoke the order.

Output: if the order has been successfully removed, a REVOKED message. Otherwise an REVOKED message

CHECK
- Returns status of an order

Output: if the specified order is still open in the system (remaining qty > 0) then an ORDER_INFO message. If this order is has been completely filled then a FILLED message. If the order Id is invalid, or if the dealer is not the owner of the specified order than an ERROR message.

LIST
- List all available orders
- command takes two optional arguments (Commodity and Dealer) 

Output: an ORDER_INFO_LIST message containing the appropriate orders.

AGGRESS

- Select an order (The ORDER_ID and QUANTITY required)

Output: if the trade was successfully made than a TRADE_REPORT message. Otherwise an ERROR message.

In any case if an invalid commodity, dealer id or order id is provided then an appropriate ERROR message should be provided.
